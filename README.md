The chat app allows users to connect with each other and chat in real-time. There are two main features of the app:

Random chat - Users can connect to a random user and chat with them.
Chat rooms - Users can create or join chat rooms with a unique room ID and chat with other users who are also in the same room.
Backend
The backend of the chat app is built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

# Installation
To install the backend dependencies, run the following command:


# Copy code
npm install express socket.io

# Configuration
The backend server can be configured in the server.js file. Here are the main configurations:

# Socket.IO events
Socket.IO enables real-time communication between the browser and the server using events. The following events are used in the chat app:

connection: Triggered when a user connects to the server.
disconnect: Triggered when a user disconnects from the server.
join-room: Triggered when a user joins a chat room.
leave-room: Triggered when a user leaves a chat room.
message: Triggered when a user sends a message in a chat room.
